This is Vibe Check’s home page! 

Here you can find your ID. This is customizable. Click on the edit icon to bring up our edit id module.

Let’s check our compatibility with our friend! 

You can look for your friend’s username or Vibe_ID by typing it into the search bar!

Once you find it simply click on it to view each other’s match story!

Once you arrive at your match story, simply click the arrow buttons to navigate through it. 

Do note:

- that Alvin and my match story will be different depending on who made the request!
- A user will only show in the search results if they have used the app

If your friend hasn’t used Vibe Check before, send them a request by:

clicking Invite → copying the link → and sending it to a friend. 

This link will automatically start the comparison between you and the user you invited once they click it.

Once you are done viewing your match story share it with friends by either downloading or click the share button and picking your social media!
